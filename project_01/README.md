## Project number 1: Outline: Class 1

# Capstone Project Plan Overview
I actually have a couple project ideas:

1. An app for smartphones that would replace restaurant POS systems.
It would be open source, and available on Apple and Android phones, 
so that a server or bartender could take orders directly at the table,
and/or the customer could order from their smartphone.  It would free 
up the restaurant from having to buy all the additional hardware and
software from POS distributors...more.

2. This one is smaller scale, and more personal.
I have a tonne of books that I inheirited when a close friend of 
mine passed away.  I don't necessarily want to throw them away,
and after checking with the library system in St. Charles County,
I've come to the conclusion that they would throw away most of them.
So, I want to make an android app that I can use with my smartphone,
that would allow me to use the camera to scan the barcode on the book,
it would scrape the Author, Title and Pricing/Resale information 
from ...where?...lib of congress?...put it in a database, and then the
app could look up how much it is selling for on ebay, Amazon,
Abe Books.  It would give me an avg. resale price for the book,
and also a total combined amount of value avged over the 3-4 websites.
That way I would know simply if I should take the time to try and sell
the entire library of books I received, or if i should just donate/toss em.


## Features

1. Restaurant app would have both Admin/Back-of-House user logins.
The Admin/Owner would input their Menu/Prices/Description on their 
page.  The endUser would login to be able to Search for restaurants
on the app, Save favorite orders at area restaurants, and Place and Pay 
for orders directly from their smartphone.  Also a restaurant employee
would be able to login through the LAN while in the Restaurant working
in order to take orders and share printers/screens in the kitchen/bar.

2. The book app would have User Login, to keep track of owned books and 
their values on the User Profile page.  And then a scanning function to add
new books, using a smartphone's camera.  


## Technologies

1. Restaurant App.
C# in Visual Studio
Xamarin (for cross-platform android and apple)
Xamarin Forms 
SQL 


2. Book App.
Java in Android Studio
SQL?  not sure what Android Studio uses for Database...Spring?
API's for Amazon

## What I'll Have to Learn
1. I'll need to figure out how to use Xamarin Forms and how to push
apps to the Play Store and App Store for Apple.

2. Oh, just about everything from using Android Studio and Java,
pretty much down the list.
