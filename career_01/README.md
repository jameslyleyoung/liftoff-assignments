## Brief description of prelimanary research	

As I don't know anything about PowerShell-other than hearing
about it in LaunchCode LC101-I'm going to be searching 
on YouTube to figure out how to launch Powershell, figure out what 
the ISE is, and how to run commands, before I head to this meetup.

# Followup:
Windows Powershell is developed by Microsoft for the purposes of 
task automation and configuration management.  It is based on the 
.NET framework, and it includes a command-line shell and scripting
language.  

ISE stands for Integrated Scripting Environment, and it is a 
graphical user interface that allows one to easily create
different scripts w/o having to type all the commands in
the command line.  

Running commands is just as simple as using the command line, 
and the Windows Powershell appears just like the CLI.


## Questions for Meetup
How is Windows PowerShell more powerful than the command prompt?
Why is it intended to replace the command prompt?
